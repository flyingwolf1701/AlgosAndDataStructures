//FizzBuzz
/* 
Write a function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 to NUM.

Put "fizz" in place of numbers divisble by 3 but not by 5,
"buzz" in place of numbers divisble by 5 but not by 3,
and "fizzbuzz" in place of numbers divisble by both 3 and 5.

fizzbuzz(16);
-> [1, 2, 'fizz', 4, 'buzz', 'fizz', 7, 8, 'fizz', 'buzz',
11, 'fizz', 13, 14, 'fizzbuzz', 16]

//Pow

/** Write a function that calculates x^y, where x is given as the base and y is given as the power.
 *
 * Example:
 * pow(2,4) => 2^4 = 16
 * Rational: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16
 *
 * Extension: Use recursion

// Duplicate Number
/*
You have an unsorted array of n + 1 numbers, with the numbers from 1 to n.
One number is duplicated. Find it.
ex: [1,5,4,3,6,2,4,7] should return 4
*/

/* EXTENSION:
You have an unsorted array of n + 1 numbers, with the range of k to k + n - 1, with an extra number that is a duplicate.
(k is not necessarily 1) Find the duplicate. Do this in O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
ex: [3, 4, 7, 6, 8, 5, 6] should return 6

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */

//Fast Cache
/*
 define a function "fastCache" that takes one argument, a function, and returns a function. 
 When fastCache is invoked it creates an object that tracks calls to the returned function, where each input to the returned function is associated with its output. 
 Every subsequent call to that returned function with the same argument will return the output directly from the object, instead of invoking the original function again.

 Extension: Rewrite fastCache so it can handle array or object input, and any number of arguments.

// Common Elememnts
/*
Write a function called commonElements that takes in any number of arrays in the 
argument. The arrays may contain both numbers and strings. It should return a new array
with all the common elements (both numbers and/or strings) from the given input. 
If there are no common numbers/strings, return "Nothing in Common!"
Assume there are no duplicates within the array.


ex: 
arr1 = [2, 10,'cat', 3, 99, 2000, 'dog', 'lion'];
arr2 = [3, 7, 2, 2000, 1, 'dog', 'cat'];
arr3 = [2, 100, 2000, 'dog', 3, 'lion'];

commonElements(arr1, arr2, arr3) -> [2, 3, 2000, 'dog']
*/

// Balanced Parens
/*
 * write a function that takes a string of text and returns true if
 * the parentheses are balanced and false otherwise.
 *
 * Example:
 *   balancedParens('(');  // false
 *   balancedParens('()'); // true
 *   balancedParens(')(');  // false
 *   balancedParens('(())');  // true
 *
 * Step 2:
 *   make your solution work for all types of brackets
 *
 * Example:
 *  balancedParens('[](){}'); // true
 *  balancedParens('[({})]');   // true
 *  balancedParens('[(]{)}'); // false
 *
 * Step 3:
 * ignore non-bracket characters
 * balancedParens(' const wow = { yo: thisIsAwesome() }'); // true
 * balancedParens(' const newton = () => { telescopes.areSicc(); '); // false
 *
 *
 */

const balancedParens = input => {

/* Merge Ranges

Write a function mergeRanges that takes an array of meeting time ranges and
returns an array of condensed ranges, merging the overlapping intervals.

Example:

intervals = [[0, 1], [3, 5], [4, 8], [10, 12], [9, 10]]
mergeRanges(intervals); -> [[0, 1], [3, 8], [9, 12]]

intervals = [[8, 10], [15, 18], [1, 3], [2, 6]]
mergeRanges(intervals); -> [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

Do not assume the ranges are in order. The intervals array will have at least
one range in it.

Hint:
Sort the intervals by their start value beforehand! This makes the problem
actually tractable. To do this, use a custom callback for the .sort() method,
described here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
(especially the part about compare numbers instead of strings)

After sorting, think about how to merge the intervals together.

const mergeRanges = intervals => {
  
};

/* Apple Stock

Consider an array called apple-stock as an argument. This array 
represents the variation of an Apple stock during a single day. 
The values in the array are in chronological order.

ex: [1000, 500, 1500, 2000, 0] --> The stock began at 1000 and closed at 0;

Write a function called highestProfit that calculates the highest profit 
you can make in the given day by buying and selling a single Apple stock. 
This is comprised of one buy and one sell. Keep your worst case 
time complexity in O(n^2).

Return 0 if no profit is possible OR if input is invalid.

** Extension **
Refactor your function to improve your time complexity to O(n).
Hint: Use pointers to keep track of the indices of max, min to 
calculate profit along the array.

*/

const highestProfit = apple_stock => {

}

/* Nested Array Max

Write a function to find the largest number in an arbitrarily nested array. 
The function should return the largest number contained anywhere in the array, 
regardless of how deeply nested it is.
Assume all elements in each array are numbers.

Ex:

const arrFlat = [1, 3, 10, 6];
nestedArrMax(arrFlat);
-> 10

const arrNested = [1, [3, [10], 6]];
nestedArrMax(arrNested);
-> 10

*/

const nestedArrMax = arr => {

};


/*

Extension:
Write a function to find the largest number in a nested array, up to and including a given level. 
Return the largest number without going deeper in the nested array than the specified level.
Assume all elements in each array are numbers.

The original array is considered to be at depth 1, any inner array is depth 2, etc.

Ex:

const arrNested = [1, [3, [10], 6]];
nestedArrMaxLevel(arrNested, 1);
-> 1

nestedArrMaxLevel(arrNested, 2);
-> 6

nestedArrMaxLevel(arrNested, 3);
-> 10
